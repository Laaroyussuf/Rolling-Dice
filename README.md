# Rolling-Die
Visualizing the frequency of possible face (result) of a dice.

These projects are done using two different Visualization modules in python which are; Matplotlib and Plotly.
The probability of getting any sides of a die is 1/2 and that is, if the die is thrown once.
Considering the frequency of any sides if the die is thrown in a number of time, this is what the project is all about.
It visualizes the frequency of any sides if the die is thrown randomly.
